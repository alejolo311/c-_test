# Task - 2 
## Statement
Given an integer (T) and a collection of integer (I), find a sub-collection (M) that the sum (S) of M's elements is the largest among all subcollections of I and S <= T. I is not sorted, M is not required to be sorted. Not required to find M with the least number of elements. I and M might contain repetitive elements. If thereâ€™s no answer found set M to an empty vector and s to 0. 
Signature of the interface.
